“Please help organize the document, thanks”
Gosh, it’s always easier said than done. I’ve got pile of document already!! Doesn’t matter, one more pile would be just a tip of an iceberg. 

I really hope the company got the Fuji Xerox BPO Center.

With the Fuji Xerox BPO Center, all I need to do is walk up to the multi-function device to scan the documents for immediate processing. I heard that from a friend working in another company. The Fuji Xerox BPO Center helps streamline and offload resources. They have many other services to make documents and information ready. Now he has so much less documents to handle and process. 

But be positive, on the other hand, he’s got more work now other than paper handling. I should be grateful that I only got data processing in my hands. I should be grateful. Be grateful.
