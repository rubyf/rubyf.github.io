There’s a lot in my mind right now. Too much information about the Fuji Xerox DocuWorks Viewer. 

The story begins when the office adopted the DocuWorks Viewer.

To be honest, the DoceWorks Viewer is a useful software for paperwork. It has all the functions to make paper documents handling feels like doing it on a physical desk, you know, the market annotation and stuff. Just put the file on cloud and present it after discussion, so that everyone can view the document easily with the device. 

The DocuWorks Viewer is just as simple as that. I totally understand the concept, but still, as a person terrible at technology, I’m not completely sure that I can work with it properly. That’s why I attended the course about the DocuWorks Viewer to learn.

Hopefully I can get this done and start with it asap.
